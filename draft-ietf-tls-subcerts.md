--- abstract

The organizational separation between the operator of a TLS endpoint and the
certification authority can create limitations.  For example, the lifetime of
certificates, how they may be used, and the algorithms they support are
ultimately determined by the certification authority.  This document describes a
mechanism by which operators may delegate their own credentials for use in TLS,
without breaking compatibility with peers that do not support this
specification.

# Introduction

Typically, a TLS server uses a certificate provided by some entity other than
the operator of the server (a "Certification Authority" or CA) {{!RFC8446}}
{{!RFC5280}}.  This organizational separation makes the TLS server operator
dependent on the CA for some aspects of its operations, for example:

* Whenever the server operator wants to deploy a new certificate, it has to
  interact with the CA.
* The server operator can only use TLS signature schemes for which the CA
  will issue credentials.

These dependencies cause problems in practice.  Server operators often deploy
TLS termination services in locations such as remote data centers
or Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) where it may be difficult to detect key
compromises.  Short-lived certificates may be used to limit the exposure of keys
in these cases.

However, short-lived certificates need to be renewed more frequently than
long-lived certificates.  If an external CA is unable to issue a certificate in
time to replace a deployed certificate, the server would no longer be able to
present a valid certificate to clients.  With short-lived certificates, there is
a smaller window of time to renew a certificates and therefore a higher risk that
an outage at a CA will negatively affect the uptime of the service.

To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document proposes a limited delegation
mechanism that allows a TLS peer to issue its own credentials within
the scope of a certificate issued by an external CA.  These credentials only enable the
recipient of the delegation to speak for names that the CA has authorized.  For
clarity, we will refer to the certificate issued by the CA as a "certificate",
or "delegation certificate", and the one issued by the operator as a "delegated
credential" or "DC".

# Conventions and Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

# Solution Overview

A delegated credential is a digitally signed data structure with two semantic
fields: a validity interval and a public key (along with its associated
signature algorithm).  The signature on the credential indicates a delegation
from the certificate that is issued to the peer.  The secret key
used to sign a credential corresponds to the public key of the peer's
X.509 end-entity certificate {{RFC5280}}.

A TLS handshake that uses delegated credentials differs from a standard handshake
in a few important ways:

* The initiating peer provides an extension in its ClientHello or CertificateRequest
  that indicates support for this mechanism.
* The peer sending the Certificate message provides both the certificate
  chain terminating in its certificate as well as the delegated credential.
* The authenticating initiator uses information from the peer's certificate
  to verify the delegated credential and that the peer is asserting an
  expected identity.
* Peers accepting the delegated credential use it as the certificate
  key for the TLS handshake

As detailed in {{delegated-credentials}}, the delegated credential is
cryptographically bound to the end-entity certificate with which the
credential may be used.  This document specifies the use of delegated
credentials in TLS 1.3 or later; their use in prior versions of the
protocol is not allowed.

Delegated credentials allow a peer to terminate TLS connections on behalf of
the certificate owner.  If a credential is stolen, there is no mechanism for
revoking it without revoking the certificate itself.  To limit exposure in case
of delegated credential private key compromise, delegated credentials have a maximum
validity period.  In the absence of an application profile standard specifying
otherwise, the maximum validity period is set to 7 days.  Peers MUST NOT issue
credentials with a validity period longer than the maximum validity period.
This mechanism is described in detail in {{client-and-server-behavior}}.

It was noted in [XPROT] that certificates in use by servers that support
outdated protocols such as SSLv2 can be used to forge signatures for
certificates that contain the keyEncipherment KeyUsage ({{RFC5280}} section
4.2.1.3).  In order to prevent this type of cross-protocol attack, we define a
new DelegationUsage extension to X.509 that permits use of delegated
credentials.  (See {{certificate-requirements}}.)

## Rationale

Delegated credentials present a better alternative than other delegation
mechanisms like proxy certificates {{?RFC3820}} for several reasons:

* There is no change needed to certificate validation at the PKI layer.
* X.509 semantics are very rich.  This can cause unintended consequences if a
  service owner creates a proxy certificate where the properties differ from the leaf
  certificate.  For this reason, delegated credentials have very restricted
  semantics that should not conflict with X.509 semantics.
* Proxy certificates rely on the certificate path building process to establish
  a binding between the proxy certificate and the server certificate.  Since
  the certificate path building process is not cryptographically protected, it is
  possible that a proxy certificate could be bound to another certificate with
  the same public key, with different X.509 parameters.  Delegated credentials,
  which rely on a cryptographic binding between the entire certificate and the
  delegated credential, cannot.
* Each delegated credential is bound to a specific signature algorithm that may
  be used to sign the TLS handshake ({{RFC8446}} section 4.2.3).  This prevents
  them from being used with other, perhaps unintended signature algorithms.


## Related Work

Many of the use cases for delegated credentials can also be addressed using
purely server-side mechanisms that do not require changes to client behavior
(e.g., a PKCS#11 interface or a remote signing mechanism [KEYLESS]).  These
mechanisms, however, incur per-transaction latency, since the front-end
server has to interact with a back-end server that holds a private key.  The
mechanism proposed in this document allows the delegation to be done
off-line, with no per-transaction latency.  The figure below compares the
message flows for these two mechanisms
with TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}}.

~~~~~~~~~~
Remote key signing:

Client            Front-End            Back-End
  |----ClientHello--->|                    |
  |<---ServerHello----|                    |
  |<---Certificate----|                    |
  |                   |<---remote sign---->|
  |<---CertVerify-----|                    |
  |        ...        |                    |


Delegated credentials:

Client            Front-End            Back-End
  |                   |<--DC distribution->|
  |----ClientHello--->|                    |
  |<---ServerHello----|                    |
  |<---Certificate----|                    |
  |<---CertVerify-----|                    |
  |        ...        |                    |
~~~~~~~~~~

These two mechanisms can be complementary.  A server could use credentials for
clients that support them, while using [KEYLESS] to support legacy clients.
The private key for a delegated credential can be used in place of a certificate
private key, so it is important that the Front-End and Back-End are parties that
have a trusted relationship in the diagram above.

Short-lived certificates with automated certificate issuance,
e.g., with Automated Certificate Managment Environment (ACME) {{?RFC8555}}
reduce the risk of key compromise, but has its limitations.
Specifically, it introduces operationally-critical interactions with a
external party and forces the the server operator dependent on the CA's
willingness to issue certificates with sufficiently short lifetimes.  It also
limits the types of algorithms supported for TLS authentication to those
the CA is willing to issue a certificate for.  Nonetheless, existing
automated issuance APIs like ACME may be useful for provisioning delegated credentials.


# Delegated Credentials

While X.509 forbids end-entity certificates from being used as issuers for
other certificates, it is valid to use them to issue other signed
objects as long as the certificate contains the digitalSignature KeyUsage
({{RFC5280}} section 4.2.1.3).  We define a new signed object format that would
encode only the semantics that are needed for this application.  The credential
has the following structure:

~~~~~~~~~~
   struct {
     uint32 valid_time;
     SignatureScheme expected_cert_verify_algorithm;
     opaque ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>;
   } Credential;
~~~~~~~~~~

valid_time:

: Time in seconds relative to the beginning of the delegation certificate's
  notBefore value after which the delegated credential is no longer valid (must not exceed 7 days).

expected_cert_verify_algorithm:

: The signature algorithm of the credential key pair, where the type
  SignatureScheme is as defined in {{RFC8446}}. This is expected to be
  the same as CertificateVerify.algorithm sent by the server.  Only signature
  algorithms allowed for use in CertificateVerify messages are allowed.  When
  using RSA, the public key MUST NOT use the rsaEncryption OID, as a result,
  the following algorithms are not allowed for use with delegated credentials:
  rsa_pss_rsae_sha256, rsa_pss_rsae_sha384, rsa_pss_rsae_sha512.

ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo:

: The credential's public key, a DER-encoded {{X.690}} SubjectPublicKeyInfo as defined in
{{RFC5280}}.

The delegated credential has the following structure:

~~~~~~~~~~
   struct {
     Credential cred;
     SignatureScheme algorithm;
     opaque signature<0..2^16-1>;
   } DelegatedCredential;
~~~~~~~~~~

algorithm:

: The signature algorithm used to verify DelegatedCredential.signature.

signature:

: The delegation, a signature that binds the credential to the end-entity
  certificate's public key as specified below. The signature scheme is specified
  by DelegatedCredential.algorithm.

The signature of the DelegatedCredential is computed over the concatenation of:

1. A string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times.
2. The context string "TLS, server delegated credentials" for servers and "TLS, client delegated credentials" for clients.
3. A single 0 byte, which serves as the separator.
4. The DER-encoded X.509 end-entity certificate used to sign the
   DelegatedCredential.
5. DelegatedCredential.cred.
6. DelegatedCredential.algorithm.

The signature effectively binds the credential to the parameters of the
handshake in which it is used.  In particular, it ensures that credentials are
only used with the certificate and signature algorithm chosen by the
delegator.

The code changes required in order to create and verify delegated credentials,
and the implementation complexity this entails, are localized to the TLS
stack.  This has the advantage of avoiding changes to security-critical and
often delicate PKI code.

## Client and Server behavior

This document defines the following TLS extension code point.

~~~~~~~~~~
   enum {
     ...
     delegated_credential(34),
     (65535)
   } ExtensionType;
~~~~~~~~~~

### Server authentication

A client which supports this specification SHALL send a
"delegated_credential" extension in its ClientHello. The body of the extension
consists of a SignatureSchemeList:

~~~~~~~~~~
   struct {
     SignatureScheme supported_signature_algorithm<2..2^16-2>;
   } SignatureSchemeList;
~~~~~~~~~~

If the client receives a delegated credential without indicating support,
then the client MUST abort with an "unexpected_message" alert.

If the extension is present, the server MAY send a delegated credential; if the
extension is not present, the server MUST NOT send a delegated credential.
The server MUST ignore the extension unless TLS 1.3 or a later version is
negotiated.

The server MUST send the delegated credential as an extension in the
CertificateEntry of its end-entity certificate; the client SHOULD ignore
delegated credentials sent as extensions to any other certificate.

The expected_cert_verify_algorithm field MUST be of a
type advertised by the client in the SignatureSchemeList and is
considered invalid otherwise.Â  Clients that receive invalid delegated
credentials MUST terminate the connection with an "illegal_parameter"
alert.

### Client authentication

A server that supports this specification SHALL send a
"delegated_credential" extension in the CertificateRequest message
when requesting client authentication.Â  The body of the
extension consists of a SignatureSchemeList.Â  If the server receives a
delegated credential without indicating support in its
CertificateRequest, then the server MUST abort with an
"unexpected_message" alert.

If the extension is present, the client MAY send a delegated credential; if the
extension is not present, the client MUST NOT send a delegated credential.
The client MUST ignore the extension unless TLS 1.3 or a later version is
negotiated.

The client MUST send the delegated credential as an extension in the
CertificateEntry of its end-entity certificate; the server SHOULD ignore
delegated credentials sent as extensions to any other certificate.

The algorithm field MUST be of a type advertised by the server
in the "signature_algorithms" extension of the CertificateRequest message
and the expected_cert_verify_algorithm field MUST be of a type
advertised by the server in the SignatureSchemeList
and considered invalid otherwise.Â  Servers that receive invalid
delegated credentials MUST terminate the connection with an
"illegal_parameter" alert.

### Validating a Delegated Credential

On receiving a delegated credential and a certificate chain, the peer
validates the certificate chain and matches the end-entity certificate to the
peer's expected identity.  It also takes the following steps:

1. Verify that the current time is within the validity interval of the credential.
   This is done by asserting that the current time is no more than the
   delegation certificate's notBefore value plus DelegatedCredential.cred.valid_time.
2  Verify that the credential's remaining validity time is no more than the maximum validity
   period. This is done by asserting that the current time is no more than the delegation
   certificate's notBefore value plus DelegatedCredential.cred.valid_time plus
   the maximum validity period.
3. Verify that expected_cert_verify_algorithm matches
   the scheme indicated in the peer's CertificateVerify message and that the
   algorithm is allowed for use with delegated credentials.
4. Verify that the end-entity certificate satisfies the conditions in
   {{certificate-requirements}}.
5. Use the public key in the peer's end-entity certificate to verify the
   signature of the credential using the algorithm indicated by
   DelegatedCredential.algorithm.

If one or more of these checks fail, then the delegated credential is deemed
invalid.  Clients and servers that receive invalid delegated credentials MUST terminate the
connection with an "illegal_parameter" alert.  If successful, the participant
receiving the Certificate message uses the public key in the credential to verify
the signature in the peer's CertificateVerify message.

## Certificate Requirements

We define a new X.509 extension, DelegationUsage, to be used in the certificate
when the certificate permits the usage of delegated credentials.  What follows
is the ASN.1 {{X.680}} for the DelegationUsage certificate extension.

~~~~~~~~~~
    ext-delegationUsage EXTENSION  ::= {
        SYNTAX DelegationUsage IDENTIFIED BY id-ce-delegationUsage
    }

    DelegationUsage ::= NULL

    id-ce-delegationUsage OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::=
        { iso(1) identified-organization(3) dod(6) internet(1)
          private(4) enterprise(1) id-cloudflare(44363) 44 }
~~~~~~~~~~

The extension MUST be marked non-critical.  (See Section 4.2 of {{RFC5280}}.)
The client MUST NOT accept a delegated credential unless the server's end-entity
certificate satisfies the following criteria:

* It has the DelegationUsage extension.
* It has the digitalSignature KeyUsage (see the KeyUsage extension defined in
  {{RFC5280}}).


# IANA Considerations

This document registers the "delegated_credentials" extension in the
"TLS ExtensionType Values" registry.  The "delegated_credentials"
extension has been assigned a code point of 34.  The IANA registry
lists this extension as "Recommended" (i.e., "Y") and indicates that
it may appear in the ClientHello (CH), CertificateRequest (CR),
or Certificate (CT) messages in TLS 1.3 {{RFC8446}}.

This document also defines an ASN.1 module for the DelegationUsage
certificate extension in {{module}}.  IANA is requested to register an
Object Identfiier (OID) for the ASN.1 in "SMI Security for PKIX Module
Identifier" arc.  An OID for the DelegationUsage certificate extension
is not needed as it is already assigned to the extension from
Cloudflare's IANA Private Enterprise Number (PEN) arc.

# Security Considerations

## Security of delegated credential's private key

Delegated credentials limit the exposure of the private key used in a TLS connection by limiting
its validity period.  An attacker who compromises the private key of a delegated
credential can act as a man-in-the-middle until the delegated credential expires.
However, they cannot create new delegated credentials.  Thus, delegated
credentials should not be used to send a delegation to an untrusted party, but
is meant to be used between parties that have some trust relationship with each
other.  The secrecy of the delegated credential's private key is thus important and several
access control mechanisms SHOULD be used to protect it, including file system
controls, physical security, or hardware security modules.


## Re-use of delegated credentials in multiple contexts

It is not possible to use the same delegated credential for both client and server
authentication because the signature contains a context string.


## Revocation of delegated credentials

Delegated credentials do not provide any additional form of early revocation.
Since it is short lived, the expiry of the delegated credential would revoke
the credential.  Revocation of the long term private key that signs the
delegated credential also implicitly revokes the delegated credential.

## Interactions with session resumption

If a client decides to cache the certificate chain and re-validate it
when resuming a connection, the client SHOULD also cache the associated
delegated credential and re-validate it.

## Privacy considerations

Delegated credentials can be valid for 7 days and it is much easier for a
service to create delegated credential than a certificate signed by a CA.  A
service could determine the client time and clock skew by creating several
delegated credentials with different expiry timestamps and observing whether the
client would accept it.  Client time could be unique and thus privacy sensitive
clients, such as browsers in incognito mode, who do not trust the service might
not want to advertise support for delegated credentials or limit the number of
probes that a server can perform.

## The impact of signature forgery attacks

When TLS 1.2 servers support RSA key exchange, they may be vulnerable to attacks
that allow forging an RSA signature over an arbitrary message [BLEI].
TLS 1.2 {{?RFC5246}} (Section 7.4.7.1.) describes a mitigation strategy requiring
careful implementation of timing resistant countermeasures for preventing these attacks.
Experience shows that in practice, server implementations may fail to fully
stop these attacks due to the complexity of this mitigation [ROBOT].
For TLS 1.2 servers that support RSA key exchange using a DC-enabled end-entity
certificate, a hypothetical signature forgery attack would allow forging a
signature over a delegated credential.
The forged credential could then be used by the attacker as the equivalent of a
man-in-the-middle certificate, valid for 7 days.

Server operators should therefore minimize the risk of using DC-enabled
end-entity certificates where a signature forgery oracle may be present.
If possible, server operators may choose to use DC-enabled certificates only for signing
credentials, and not for serving non-DC TLS traffic.
Furthermore, server operators may use elliptic curve certificates for DC-enabled
traffic, while using RSA certificates without the DelegationUsage certificate
extension for non-DC traffic; this completely prevents such attacks.
